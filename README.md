# Manifold-Curvature

This repository contains example implementations and experiments related to the paper **"Manifold-based approach for neural network robustness analysis"**.

One of the key contributions of the paper is the introduction of a **manifold-based curvature metric** that serves as a **black-box robustness measure** for neural networks. This repository includes:

- An implementation of the proposed curvature metric.
- A replication of the results shown in **Figure 2** of the paper.
- An example of how this metric works on a 3D point cloud object (Stanford Bunny)
